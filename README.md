# Music Events Application
Displays music events in cities using MySQL. Currently, only designed and some groundwork on Class Structure completed.

To Do:
- Create search for artist, venue, city, and state
- create filter for date, artist, venue, city, and state
- Create views for Artist details, Event details, and Venue details (using ajax?)
- Allow pictures for artist and venue inside of views
- set default picture for artist and venue 
- Set-up authentication
- Create login portal
- CRUD for logged in users (delete and update only for admin)
